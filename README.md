## Hi there 👋
I am JiaHeak, a final-year undergraduate student of BSc Physics at the University of Malaya, Malaysia. Although I am a Physics student, I am very interested in the Astrophysics & Cosmology, and I will pursue my postgraduate studies in these. 

I studied radio astronomy for my Final Year Project, focusing on multifrequency observations of an AGN. 

For now, I have switched my research direction to computational astrophysics and simulations. I am learning the GADGET-4 simulation and practicing visualization techniques.
