## Hi there 👋
I am JiaHeak, a final-year undergraduate student of BSc Physics at the University of Malaya, Malaysia. Although I am a Physics student, I am very interested in Astrophysics & Cosmology, and I will pursue my postgraduate studies in these. 

I studied radio astronomy for my Final Year Project, focusing on multifrequency observations of an AGN. 

For now, my research direction has been switched to computational astrophysics and simulations. I am learning the GADGET-4 simulation and practicing visualization techniques, such as yt and Pynbody libraries. Regarding postgraduate research, I will likely focus on galactic formation and baryonic physics that could influence the evolution of galaxies.
