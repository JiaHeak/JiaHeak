## Hi there 👋
I am JiaHeak, a final-year undergraduate student of BSc Physics at the University of Malaya, Malaysia. Although I am a Physics student, I am very interested in Astrophysics & Cosmology, and I will pursue my postgraduate studies in these. 

I studied radio astronomy for my Final Year Project, focusing on multifrequency observations of the AGN -- PKS 1510-089, which is a blazar. 

For now, my research direction has been switched to computational astrophysics and simulations. I am learning GADGET-4 simulations and practicing visualization techniques, such as yt and Pynbody libraries. Regarding postgraduate research, I will likely focus on galactic formation and baryonic physics that could influence the evolution of galaxies.
